### hi, i'm shikha! 

![Screenshot 2024-03-06 at 10 10 49 PM](https://github.com/Shikhapatell/Shikhapatell/assets/60987296/a6e813ec-dda2-49bd-9e5f-3b4b3e37d75d)

i'm shikha patel, a recent graduate and data engineer with a background in technology consulting. i'm passionate about using data and technology to make a meaningful impact—whether it's through optimizing systems or supporting causes i care deeply about.

my experience spans cloud data pipelines, sql, and distributed systems, and i’ve worked across industries to help clients unlock the full potential of their data. i love bridging the gap between technical solutions and real-world impact.

outside of work, i’m passionate about cancer awareness and advocacy. this summer, i’m riding from austin, texas to alaska with the texas 4000 organization to help fund cancer research and support those affected. it’s a cause that’s close to my heart, and i’m honored to be part of a community that’s biking toward hope.

thanks for stopping by—i’m always excited to connect with others who care about using technology for good.
