### hi, i'm shikha! 


<img width="943" alt="Screenshot 2025-06-23 at 7 40 11 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1c26d57c-0b61-45be-a128-0e511d7fd0d0" />

i'm shikha patel, a recent graduate and data engineer with a background in technology consulting. i'm passionate about using data and technology to make a meaningful impactâ€”whether it's through optimizing systems or supporting causes i care deeply about.

my experience spans cloud data pipelines, sql, and distributed systems, and iâ€™ve worked across industries to help clients unlock the full potential of their data. i love bridging the gap between technical solutions and real-world impact.

outside of work, iâ€™m passionate about cancer awareness and advocacy. this summer, iâ€™m riding from austin, texas to alaska with the **texas 4000** organization to help fund cancer research and support those affected. itâ€™s a cause thatâ€™s close to my heart, and iâ€™m honored to be part of a community thatâ€™s biking toward hope.
